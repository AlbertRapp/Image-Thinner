1. Upload a .png- or .jpg-file that is smaller than 10MB.
2. Decide how many pixels you want to skip. 
This will 
  - plot the first pixel from your image's grid of pixels,
  - skip the next `x` pixels (column-wise + wrapping at end of column),
  - plot the next pixel.
3. Choose point size, flip axes (if necessary) and hit the button.
